# helm-chart-generator

Written in Go this cli tool creates helm chart files with certain standards.
A fun project for writing code.

For now you just can create some basic helm structures and it doesn't provide
any additional functions to the already awesome official `helm` cli.

Maybe some time in the future this project will be an upgrade or benefit for
using it. For the time being, it's just for fun only.

Feel free to add some comments or issues, if you see any major mistakes or
better practices then I did it.

Enjoy!
